Next, one can choose an algorithm (forecasting model) and evaluate how well this particular algorithm works on this dataset.

    "Amazon Forecast provides several state-of-the-art forecasting algorithms including classic forecasting methods such as ETS, ARIMA, Prophet and deep learning approaches such as DeepAR+. Classical forecasting methods, such as Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) or Exponential Smoothing (ETS), fit a single model to each individual time series, and then use that model to extrapolate the time series into the future. Amazon's Non-Parametric Time Series (NPTS) forecaster also fits a single model to each individual time series.  Unlike the naive or seasonal naive forecasters that use a fixed time index (the previous index $T-1$ or the past season $T - \\tau$) as the prediction for time step $T$, NPTS randomly samples a time index $t \\in \\{0, \\dots T-1\\}$ in the past to generate a sample for the current time step $T$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In many applications, you may encounter many similar time series across a set of cross-sectional units. Examples of such time series groupings are demand for different products, server loads, and requests for web pages. In this case, it can be beneficial to train a single model jointly over all of these time series. CNN-QR and DeepAR+ take this approach, outperforming the standard ARIMA and ETS methods when your dataset contains hundreds of related time series. The trained model can also be used for generating forecasts for new time series that are similar to the ones it has been trained on. \n",
    "\n",
    "While deep learning approaches can outperform standard methods, this is only possible when there is sufficient data available for training. It is not true for example when one trains a neural network with a time-series containing only a few dozen observations. Amazon Forecast provides the best of two worlds allowing users to either choose a specific algorithm or let Amazon Forecast automatically perform model selection. \n",

    "\n",
    "## How to evaluate a forecasting model?\n",
    "\n",
    "Before moving forward, let's first introduce the notion of *backtest* when evaluating forecasting models. The key difference between evaluating forecasting algorithms and standard ML applications is that we need to make sure there is no future information gets used in the past. In other words, the procedure needs to be causal. \n",
